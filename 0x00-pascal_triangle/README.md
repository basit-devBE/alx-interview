# Pascal's Triangle

## Description
Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that consists of a triangular array of numbers. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and each row is constructed by adding a 0 at the beginning and end, and then summing adjacent numbers from the previous row.

## Example
Here is an example of Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows:
